# Air Force Portal Redesign

Redesigned by SOS Class 21-A Air University Advanced Research User Experience team.
Designed to be mobile first, utilizing modern technology and REST API to create a personalized dashboard for the user.

## Installation
Create a folder for the repository
```bash
mkdir afp
git init
git clone https://github.com/chris-m92/afp.git
```

## Dependencies
Requires Node to run

## Running
From my development environment, the default port is `3300`

cd /var/www/html/afp
npm start
```

Open your browser and navigate to `127.0.0.1:3300`

## Demo / Proof of Concept
To begin, input dummy information, this is to show the example of dynamic information the portal can provide.
Once provided, the user can view their 'customized' portal experience
